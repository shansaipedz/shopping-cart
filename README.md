# 🛒 React Shopping Cart Application

## Description

This project is a modern **React.js** application that implements a simple e-commerce workflow: product browsing, cart management, and checkout. It uses **React Router** for page navigation and leverages **component-based architecture** to manage product listings, cart functionality, and order processing in a clean, modular way.

Users can:

* Browse a list of products
* Add items to their shopping cart
* Adjust quantities or remove items
* Proceed to a checkout page and simulate purchase confirmation

This app is ideal as a front-end project for React learners or as a base for further e-commerce development.

## Features

* 🛍️ Product catalog with "Add to Cart" functionality
* 🧺 Cart management (add, remove, update quantity)
* 💰 Checkout page with order summary
* 🔁 React Router navigation (`/` for shop, `/checkout` for final step)
* ✨ Clean responsive UI styled with custom CSS
* ⚛️ Functional components and React Hooks (`useState`)

## Technologies Used

* React.js (Vite + JSX)
* React Router DOM
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* CSS (custom styles in `index.css`)
